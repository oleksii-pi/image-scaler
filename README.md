# Image Scaler

## Install on Mac:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oleksii-pi/image-scaler
cd image-scaler
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

## Main Features and Limitations:

- Automatically scales PNG images in specified folders to multiple predefined sizes:
  - 16x20 (1600px x 2000px)
  - 11x14 (1100px x 1400px)
  - 18x24 (1800px x 2400px)
  - 24x36 (2400px x 3600px)
  - 50x70 (5000px x 7000px)
- Crops images to maintain the aspect ratio and maximize usage of the original image.
- Outputs scaled images into appropriately named ZIP archives.
- Ensures that each archive does not exceed 20 MB.
- Processes all subfolders in the specified directory that do not contain a `scaled` subfolder.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- `pip` package manager
- MacOS (other systems may require adjustments to the `run.sh` script).

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Make the `run.sh` script executable using `chmod +x run.sh`.
3. Run the script with `./run.sh`.
4. Place your images in the desired folder structure within the root directory.
5. The script will automatically detect folders and process PNG images.

## Output:

- Processes all unprocessed subfolders in the current folder that do not yet contain a `scaled` subfolder.
- Scaled images are saved in a `scaled` subfolder within each processed directory.
- Archives are named using the folder name and size (e.g., `Birds_16x20.zip`).
- If an archive exceeds 20MB, it is split into multiple archives (e.g., `Birds_16x20_2.zip`).

# Clickable application link for MacOS

To create a clickable link for your Bash script that will execute it in its context (i.e., the directory where the script is located), the best approach is to use Automator to create an application. This is preferable because it can open the script in a terminal window, allowing it to run in the right context. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to doing this:

### Using Automator

1. **Open Automator:**

   - Open `Automator` from `Applications > Automator`.

2. **Create a New Project:**

   - Select `New Document`.
   - Choose `Application` as the type of document.

3. **Add Shell Script Action:**

   - In the Automator library on the left-side, search for `Run Shell Script`.
   - Drag the `Run Shell Script` action to the workflow area on the right.

4. **Configure the Shell Script:**

   - In the `Run Shell Script` action:
     - Set `Shell` to `/bin/bash` (the default).
   - Replace the default script with the following command to run your script:

     ```bash
     cd /{full-path}/image-scaler && ./run.sh
     ```

   This command will change to the desired directory and then execute the `run.sh` script.

5. **Save the Application:**

   - Go to `File > Save`.
   - Name your application something like `Run Image Scaler`.
   - Choose to save it on your Desktop for easy access.

6. **Run the Application:**
   - You can now double-click the application you created on your Desktop. It will open a terminal window and execute your script in the correct context.
